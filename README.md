The project was developed only for learning purposes to improve my knowledges, just a pet project

The project is built on **NestJS** and utilizes **JWT authentication**, **Redis**, **S3 storage**, and **TypeORM**.

---

## Core Technologies
**NestJS** – Framework for the server-side application.
**TypeORM** – ORM for database management.  
**PostgreSQL** – databases.

---

## Authentication & Security
**JWT (jsonwebtoken)** – Authorization and session management (with refresh token).

---

## Performance
**Redis** – Session management (`redis.service.ts`).  

---

## File Storage
**Amazon S3** – Storage for files and images (`s3.service.ts`).  

---

## API & Request Processing
**REST API** – Architectural style for handling HTTP requests.
